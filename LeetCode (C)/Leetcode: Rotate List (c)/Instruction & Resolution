1.The propose:

practice using C language to solve Rotate List 

2.The rule:

Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
Output: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
Example 2:

Input: 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
Output: 2->0->1->NULL

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL
rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL


3.Solution:

We first use the location of first node in list to get new location of first node through the .
Then, we can know that its left and right need to be placed how many nodes we need to insert.
